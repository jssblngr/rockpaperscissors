The Odin Project Rock Paper Scissors Challenge

"We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. If you don’t know what that is check the Wikipedia article or this ridiculous step-by-step. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit it and add a front end later so don’t forget to keep the code on GitHub! You might notice some ‘view in browser’ links in the student solutions - this is coming in a later lesson. When you get there don’t forget to come back and add your link!"

I went a little further than required for the project, writing the results to the page and doing some conditional checks and loops.  Fun challenge!
